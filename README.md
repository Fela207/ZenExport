**The "Peace of Mind" Local Save Workflow for Fusion 360.**

ZenExport is a Fusion 360 Add-In that replaces the native Cloud Save (`Ctrl+S`) with a powerful local asset manager. It forces a disciplined, organized folder structure on your hard drive, keeping your intellectual property safe and your versions easy to manage.

## ✨ Features that Spark Joy

- **🚫 Ctrl+S Override:** We intercept the native save command. No more "Cloud Save" dialogs. One press, one local backup.
  
- **🧠 Smart Context Binding:**
  - Set up a project one time. ZenExport remembers which local folder belongs to each open tab, even "Untitled" ones!
  - Switch tabs, press Save, and it goes to the right place every time.

- **💾 Incremental Versioning:** Automatically saves as `Project_v01.f3d`, `Project_v02.f3d`, and so on. Never overwrite history, always keep track.

- **🚀 Easy-to-Use Interface:** ZenExport integrates smoothly with Fusion 360, making it intuitive for all users.
