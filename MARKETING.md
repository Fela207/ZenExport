## Option 1: The "Problem Solver" Hook (Best for r/Fusion360)

**Title:** I built the "Save As" feature Fusion 360 forgot: Auto-Backup + Versioning + STLs in 1 click

**Body:**
Hey everyone! 👋

I got tired of the "10 active document limit" dancing and the fear of saving over a file I needed. So I wrote a script called **ZenExport**.

It basically acts like a "Super Save" button:

1.  **Time Machine:** It saves your source files (`.f3d` & `.step`) into versioned folders (`v01`, `v02`...) so you never lose history.
2.  **Auto-STL:** It exports every body in your design as an individual `.stl` automatically (great for slicing).
3.  **Visuals:** It takes a snapshot of your viewport so the folder has a thumbnail.

It's free and open source. Just wanted to share it with the community in case it saves someone else a headache! 🧘
